					<h2>Career</h2>
				</div>

			<div class="container">
				<div class="col">
					<p>
						I began my career in 2003, in the German multinational Henkel, where I was the web and digital designer responsible for the Loctite brand website, which passed through a huge website change in 2004. I joined a worldwide group designated to unify the Loctite website layout using a singular template powered by a multi-language CMS. I was sent to Los Angeles to the CMS course and after that, I was set to minister the same course in Brazil, Santiago (Chile) and Buenos Aires (Argentina). My efforts generated time and costs saving with the implementation in the whole region. I was the guy of other jobs such as motion graphics ads (using flash software), company’s online communications, hot-sites creation, email marketing designs, offline stuff, and even participated in huge events such as Formula 1 and many other international industrial fairs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h3>
						By that time I was pretty convinced all the design I made had to be orientated to the end user.
					</h3>
					<p>
						After almost 3 years I decided to face a new challenge at HSM, an Argentine-brazilian multinational company, specialized in management education. 
I was the web designer responsible for the company’s events portal, e-commerce and email marketing creation and development. I was sent to Buenos Aires to deeply learn the brand’s guide which was another enriching experience. I successfully developed several online materials engaging new leads and selling lots of events’ tickets. Also joined the team for the events, and at the Expomanagement, a huge event, I sold more than 2 hundred thousand real (brazilian currency) in forthcoming events.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<p>
						After a year I decided to push myself into a totally new challenge, idealizing my own company, Web It Out. It was hard at the beginning, few clients, few jobs, little money... but it gave me a whole new experience in different areas besides designing. I improved my Customer service SEO, SEM, SMM skills, and finally put me in touch with the User experience Design.
						Speaking of which, through Web It Out I had made some important UX and UI jobs. It is relevant to list the work for the Italian telecom TIM, where I idealized a sales department app, where salesman, supervisors and managers accessed a database detailing all the team works, prospects, leads, meetings, etc.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<p>
						I did a great job for Footstats, a soccer BI platform, where I designed and developed the front-end of the Footstats social media network for desktop, responsive and the app versions. 

						Also produced a prototype for the Gover app, of Kontik, a B2B travel company.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">					
					<p>
						Back in Brazil I had a large experience with Banks too.
For the Rendimento bank, I was responsible for the customer journey map of the digital subscription application. Also made the responsive front-end version for that client.
In Alfa Bank, I designed and developed (front end) for desktop and responsive versions of the personal credit website.
At Safra Bank I set up the customer journey map, designed, prototyped and also developed the front-end for an online system for end-users.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<p>
						And it is worthy to cite I have done a prototype of a fashion app for C&A, a worldwide store.
						In march 2019, I decided to idealize a new company, Olá! Alongside my wife, who is a graduate journalist, SEO and content marketing specialist.
